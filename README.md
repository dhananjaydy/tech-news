Hi, this is a sample app as per the requirements. 

Some points on the work:
- Network requests without using any third party library
- Glide to manage image loading
- Coroutines to delegate work on suitable threads
- Custom theming for better look and feel

POinters to help the reader understand perspective better:
- Comment with certain lines of code trying to describe what they intend to do
- At the end of some main package folder, you may find future TODOs signifying what are the possibilities
  to help improve the case coverage which in turn would help improve the user experience by a significant amount

Following is the screenshot of how the app home screen looks like -
